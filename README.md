# rancher/aks-operator

AKS operator is a Kubernetes CRD controller that controls cluster provisioning in Azure Kubernetes Service using an AKSClusterConfig defined by a Custom Resource Definition.

## Latest TAG version

    TAG=v1.0-rc1 make

## Build

    go build -o aks-operator main.go

## Test

Deploy the CRD

    export KUBECONFIG=<kubeconfig_path>
    kubectl apply -f crds/aksclusterconfig.yaml

Edit the CRD

    cp examples/create-example.yaml examples/create-aks.yaml
    vim examples/create-aks.yaml

Create AKS secret with clientID and clientSecret

    export REPLACE_WITH_K8S_SECRETS_NAME=aks-secret
    kubectl create secret generic $REPLACE_WITH_K8S_SECRETS_NAME --from-literal=azurecredentialConfig-subscriptionId=<REPLACE_WITH_SUBSCRIPTIONID> --from-literal=azurecredentialConfig-clientId=<REPLACE_WITH_CLIENTID> --from-literal=azurecredentialConfig-clientSecret=<REPLACE_WITH_CLIENTSECRET>

Start the AKS operator

    ./aks-operator

Apply the CRD

    kubectl apply -f examples/create-aks.yaml

Watch the logs

Delete the AKS cluster

    kubectl delete -f examples/create-aks.yaml

Running unit tests

    make test

## Develop

The easiest way to debug and develop the AKS operator is to replace the default operator on a running Rancher instance with your local one.

* Run a local Rancher server
* Provision an AKS cluster
* Scale the aks-operator deployment to replicas=0 in the Rancher UI
* Open the aks-operator repo in Goland, set `KUBECONFIG=<kubeconfig_path>` in Run Configuration Environment
* Run the aks-operator in Debug Mode
* Set breakpoints

## Release

#### When should I release?

A KEv2 operator should be released if

* There have been several commits since the last release,
* You need to pull in an update/bug fix/backend code to unblock UI for a feature enhancement in Rancher
* The operator needs to be unRC for a Rancher release

#### How do I release?

Tag the latest commit on the `master` branch. For example, if latest tag is `v1.0.8-rc1` you would tag `v1.0.8-rc2`.

    git pull upstream master --tags     // get the latest upstream changes (not your fork)
    git tag v1.0.8-rc2                  // tag HEAD
    git push upstream v1.0.8-rc2        // push the tag

Submit a [rancher/charts PR](https://github.com/rancher/charts/pull/2242) to update the operator and operator-crd chart versions.
Submit a [rancher/rancher PR](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/39745) to update the bundled chart.

#### How do I unRC?

UnRC is the process of removing the rc from a KEv2 operator tag and means the released version is stable and ready for use. Release the KEv2 operator but instead of bumping the rc, remove the rc. For example, if the latest release of AKS operator is `v1.0.8-rc1`, release the next version without the rc which would be `v1.0.9`.
